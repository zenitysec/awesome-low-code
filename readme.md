## Platforms

### Automation and Integration

Integration Platform as a Service
A platform that help organizations control, simplify and standardize the way that applications are integrated (internally developed or 3rd party SaaS). Such platforms help to share data between applications, automate business workflows and remove manual error prone ones, in an advanced controlled manner. iPaaS also enables more types of personas to integrate applications, removing the constant dependency on software developers. iPaaS can be deployed within an organization either as a SaaS or as on-premises appliance.
Business Process Automation
An automation platform that enables business users with no coding background to automate complicated business workflows and actions by providing an easy to use drag&drop interface. Automations that are built in such platforms are usually built in an event-driven mode (triggers) around critical business processes. BPA can be consumed via a SaaS or an on-premises appliance.
